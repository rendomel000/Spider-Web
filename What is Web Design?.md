Web Design is the study of programming languages that are used to develop a digital product that can be seen on a browser by other people. The significance of it being a branch of design would entail that the product is intended to be at the very least attractive to the eyes; this would include an already adept understanding of either the color theory, typography, or appropriate levels of organization. HTML, CSS, and Javascript are just a few examples of languages that are necessary to learning the basics.
