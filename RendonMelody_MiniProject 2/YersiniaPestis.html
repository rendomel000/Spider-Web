			<p>The bacterium Yersinia pestis is the most often theorized culprit behind the Black Death. The bacteria is carried by insects, such as fleas or mosquitoes, and spreads to other mammals. It is both airborne and bloodborne, making it highly contagious, especially during the late middle ages.Yersinia consists of three branches of pathogenic bacteria: Yersinia pestis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. All diseases or ailments caused by the genus Yersinia are referred to as Yersiniosis. </p>
			<p>Yersinia enterocolitica is spread through the consumption or handling of raw meat, and uncommonly by consuming milk that has been improperly treated). Unlike Yersinia pestis, Yersinia enterocolitica causes primarily stomach pains and bloody stool, only ever rarely inflicting rashes. It has a mortality rate of 50%.</p>
			<p> Similarly, Yersinia psuedotuberculosis is spread through contaminated meats and milk. It is also able to be spread through water. Pseudotuberculosis often branches from the transmission of Yersinia enterocolitica, so it's not uncommon to contract both around the same time. Like enterocolitica, symptoms include fever and diarrhea. However, Yersinia psuedotuberculosis is much rarer than its' two sister bacteria, and has a mortality rate of 75%.</p>
			<p>Yersinia pestis is most often spread through fleas and rats, but other animals such as cats and dogs can also be infected. The mortality rate, for people who have been treated with the appropriate antibiotics, is 1 - 15% in modern times. For people who haven't been treated, the mortality rate rises to at least 50%.
