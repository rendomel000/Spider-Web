<h3>Q: What is Web Design?</h3>
<font size=>A: Web Design is the study of programming languages that are used to develop a digital product that can be seen on a browser by other people. The significance of it being a branch of design would entail that the product is intended to be at the very least attractive to the eyes; this would include an already adept understanding of either the color theory, typography, or appropriate levels of organization. HTML, CSS, and Javascript are just a few examples of languages that are necessary to learning the basics.</font>

<h3>Q: What is the Web?</h3>
<font size=>A: The web is a navigable network consisting of hundreds of digital servers. It was originally intended as a form of sharing information with others over long-distance, as designed by Tim Berners-Lee. The web only became popularized after its' second launch; the first version was made specifically for the private company CERN. Today, it is not only used as an alternative to sharing information, but is used to additionally hotlink website to website (using a browser quickly sandwiches these links together).</font>
